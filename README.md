# Intro

Hello, my name is Sean. I am a graduate student within the School of Geography and Earth Sciences at McMaster University. My research focus is on understanding the barriers to freight congestion in Canada as they are perceived by stakeholders.

## My Research

My research is built off of interviews that were conducted by the McMaster Institute for Transportation and Logistics (MITL). The interviews were orignially used to inform a report titled _Developing a Set of Freight Performance Measures for Ontario_, which I co-authored. The material was also used for a report I wrote titled _Metropolitan Freight Congestion in Canada: Measures, Causes, Implications, and Policies_, which is awaiting publishing through MITL. 

To add academic rigour to these reports, and to produce journal articles which form the basis of my graduate thesis, I learned how to employ a Grounded Theory methodological framework which allows for a theory to emerge from the data. Through an exhaustive process of line-by-line, focused, and axial coding, assisted by NVivo software, an overall theory was developed from the interviews. To refine the outputs, a second coding process is underway in which the data is split by stakeholder categorization. The intended output will be two seperate theories which will then be contrasted against each - which will hopefully generate some interesting results.

## GitHub

This is my first GitHub repository. It is being created and maintained as a function of the graduate seminar Geog 712, which focuses on how to produce reproducible research and teaching best practices for data management.

This repository will be used to store information, assignments, and other related data for the Geog 712 course.
