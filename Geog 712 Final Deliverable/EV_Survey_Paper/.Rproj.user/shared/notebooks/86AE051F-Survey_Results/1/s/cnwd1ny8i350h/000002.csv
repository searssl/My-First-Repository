"0","# The shortest amount of time and the least number of chages made to the exercise are both zero, which is unacceptable. The other concern is that some respondents spent excessive amounts of time to complete the design space and their responses may not be truly reflective. Respondents are filtered out if more than 20 minutes was taken to complete the exercise. The average time spent to complete the exercise was 3 minutes. Additionally, there is concern that respondents did not spend an adequate amount of time to fully understand the exercise. The removal of respondents is based off of the distribution of responses, those outside of 3 standard distributions of the data are considered to be outliers and are excluded from the analysis. A sensitivity analysis may be completed to compare the truncated dataset and the affect on the results, against all non-zero time and change values (i.e., any respondents who did not complete the design space are not included)."

"0","#Respondents were allowed, and encouraged, to make as many changes (moving the slider bars to different values) as they felt necessary to understand the different options available to them. Based off of the random geneation pattern, it is plausible that an individual could have been initialized with a vehicle combination they were content with (e.g., ICE-configuration with low purchase and operating cost) and as such respondents at minimum needed to only move the slider bar once to be able to continue. Respondents who made zero changes are removed."
